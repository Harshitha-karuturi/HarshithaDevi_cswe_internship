Drone Telemetry Dashboard – Project Explanation
Overview

For this task, I developed a web-based Drone Telemetry Dashboard that simulates real-time flight data for a drone. The system visually displays key telemetry parameters such as altitude, speed, battery percentage, GPS coordinates, distance traveled, and additional system metrics like voltage, current, temperature, pitch, roll, and heading.

The goal of this project was to recreate a simplified Ground Control Station (GCS) interface similar to professional drone monitoring software, while keeping the design clean, structured, and easy to understand.

What I Built

I created a single-page web application that simulates a 30-second drone flight mission. The interface includes:

Circular telemetry gauges (Altitude, Speed, Battery, Distance)

Live mission timer with progress bar

GPS coordinates display

System status panel (Voltage, Current, Temperature, Flight Mode)

Flight data panel (Heading, Pitch, Roll, Vertical Speed)

Dynamic color indicators for warnings (e.g., low battery or voltage)

The UI was designed to resemble a professional telemetry monitoring system used in aerospace applications.

How It Works

The system runs a simulated flight for 30 seconds. Every 1 second, the telemetry data updates automatically using JavaScript.

Here’s how the logic works:

A timer counts down from 30 seconds.

At each interval:

Altitude increases to a peak and then decreases (simulating takeoff and landing).

Speed varies using a sine wave function combined with small random variations.

Battery gradually decreases over time.

Distance accumulates based on speed.

GPS coordinates shift slightly to simulate movement.

System parameters (voltage, temperature, etc.) adjust dynamically.

The circular gauges are SVG-based and update visually by modifying the stroke-dashoffset property to reflect percentage values.

Colors change automatically for warning conditions (e.g., battery turning red when low).

After 30 seconds, the mission completes and the system status changes to “Mission Complete”.

Tools and Technologies Used

The project was developed using:

HTML5 – For structuring the dashboard layout.

CSS3 – For styling the interface, grid layout, responsiveness, and professional dashboard design.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – For telemetry simulation, mathematical calculations, dynamic updates, and DOM manipulation.

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) – For building smooth animated circular gauges.

No external libraries or frameworks were used. The entire project runs directly in a browser without requiring additional dependencies.

Key Design Decisions

I used a dark aviation-style theme to reflect real-world drone ground control interfaces.

Circular gauges were chosen to visually represent telemetry percentages in a professional way.

The simulation logic was written to mimic realistic drone behavior instead of using completely random values.

The layout was structured using CSS Grid for a clean and organized interface.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how a real-time drone telemetry monitoring system can be simulated using only front-end web technologies. It combines UI design, mathematical logic, and dynamic data visualization to create an interactive dashboard.

The system is lightweight, easy to run, and clearly demonstrates understanding of telemetry concepts and real-time data simulation.
